# Python-Waldo-Finder
It tries its best but some of these Waldo pictures were made to fool human eyes beyond what an algorithm is capable of catching.

findWaldo.py uses color segmentation to try (and usually fail) to find Waldo.
It requires NumPy, SciPy, Scikits-Image, and the Python Imaging Library

To run it (after installing the libraries) 
The commandline should say:
python findWaldo.py impossibleWaldo2.tif
This was done in Python 2, due to the lack of image processing libraries in Python 3
