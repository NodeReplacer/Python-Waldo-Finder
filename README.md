# Python-Waldo-Finder

findWaldo.py uses color segmentation to try (and usually fail) to find Waldo.

It requires NumPy, SciPy, Scikits-Image, and the Python Imaging Library

To run it (after installing the libraries) type into your commandline:

python findWaldo.py impossibleWaldo2.tif


This was done in Python 2, due to the lack of image processing libraries in Python 3
